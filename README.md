# Credit Card Default Prediction
## Problem Discription 
In recent years, the credit card issuers in Taiwan faced the cash and credit card debt crisis and the delinquency is expected to peak in the third quarter of 2006 (Chou,2006). In order to increase market share, card-issuing banks in Taiwan over-issued cash and credit cards to unqualified applicants. At the same time, most cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, overused credit card for consumption and accumulated heavy credit and cashâ€“card debts. The crisis caused the blow to consumer finance confidence and it is a big challenge for both banks and cardholders.

## Dataset
We used the [Credit Card Default payment in Taiwan] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients) to predict whether the credit card holders are defaulters or Non-defaulters. The Dataset and its attributes are described below

ID: ID of each client

LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit

SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female)

EDUCATION: (1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others, 5=unknown, 6=unknown)

MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=others)

AGE: Age in years

PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 2=payment delay for two months,8=payment delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above)

PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)

PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)

PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)

PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)

PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)

BILL_AMT1: Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT2: Amount of bill statement in August, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT3: Amount of bill statement in July, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT4: Amount of bill statement in June, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT5: Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT1: Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar)

default.payment.next.month: Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)

## Conclusion
More credit card defualt for limit balance about 10000. It might mean that credit card might be too easy to be issued for people who have low credit scores. The variance of the default rate for limit balance over 500,000 NTD is higher than other range of limit balance. It is lower default rate for cardholders have higher education level. Moreover, the default rate for clients whose age over 60 was higher than mid age and young people. The best fit algorithm for predicting limit balance is bagging approach. The best fit algorithm for predicting whether a client default next month is classification tree.
